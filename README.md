Welcome to PitPat Analysis: Unraveling the Pathways in Pituitary Adenomas,
In this comprehensive analysis, we delve into the intricate world of pituitary adenomas, specifically focusing on two distinct types: Growth Hormone (GH) adenomas and Non-Functioning Pituitary Adenomas (NFPAs). The primary objective of this study is to identify Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) and uncover the underlying pathways that contribute to the pathogenesis of these Pituitary Adenomas.
Through advanced bioinformatics techniques and statistical analyses, we aim to shed light on the molecular intricacies that distinguish GH adenomas from NFPAs. The extraction of DEGs will pave the way for a deeper understanding of the genetic landscape, ultimately unraveling the key pathways involved in the development and progression of these adenomas. The following table of contents will be found on the USB flash drive to be handed in together with the dissertation write-up. However, this GitHub directory https://github.com/llryab01/LidiaRyabova includes all the programs related to the analysis from quality control and alignment procedures all the way to DESeq2 Differential Gene Expression Analysis.
